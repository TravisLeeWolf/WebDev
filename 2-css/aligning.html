    <h2>CSS Text Aligning</h2>
    <p>Here we look at how we can change the alginment of our text with CSS.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      In the case of alginment it's done to the parent tag, so in this case the
      text below is aligned to the body (entire page).
    </p>
    <p class="right">Right aligned to the body.</p>
    <p>To better illustrate this we use a divider element.</p>
    <div>
      <p class="right">This text is to the right.</p>
      <p class="centered">This text is centered.</p>
      <p class="justified">
        Here we have some text that is justified, which means that it will bit
        fit to the edges of the divider and change it's word spacing to achieve
        this as shown.
      </p>
    </div>
  </body>
