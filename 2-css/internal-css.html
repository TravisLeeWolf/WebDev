    <h3>Inline and Internal CSS</h3>
    <p>
      CSS can be done inline with HTML but this means for each aspect you want
      to apply CCS it needs to be added in said HTML tag.
    </p>
    <p>
      Internal CSS allows you to separate the HTML and CSS code for ease-of-use
      in programming a webpage.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Internal CSS affects HTML tags that it's directed at, so in this case all
      paragraph tags have been sylized.
    </p>
    <p>
      To change this you need to assign classes, shown in the next tutorial.
