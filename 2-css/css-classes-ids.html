    <h2>Internal CSS with classes</h2>
    <p>
      When you assign a HTML element to a class it allows you to target that
      class an change only its CSS
    </p>
    <p class="red">
      This is a paragraph with the first class, in red and 25% bigger.
    </p>
    <p class="blue">
      This is a paragraph with the second class, in blue and 25% smaller.
    </p>
    <p id="green">
      In this case we are using an id and not a class so the code for CSS is
      different, see comments.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      IDs are used once in a single page but classes can be used multiple times,
      hence in the paragraphs above it's better to use classes.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p class="red">
      Lastly we can use both the class and span to target some text within a
      paragraph,
      <span class="underlined">here to add additional CSS like underline.</span>
    </p>
